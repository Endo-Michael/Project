# Speech-to-Text Recognition System
Introduction

The Speech-to-Text Recognition System is an AI-powered application that converts spoken language into written text using the Vosk speech recognition library. This project utilizes a pre-trained Vosk model to process audio input in real-time and transcribe it into text. The system is designed for efficient, offline speech recognition, making it suitable for various applications, including transcription services and accessibility tools.

Objectives

Develop a speech-to-text system that operates efficiently without internet connectivity.

Utilize Vosk, a lightweight and accurate speech recognition model.

Provide an intuitive GUI-based user experience for speech input and text output.

System Overview

This project consists of the following components:

Vosk Speech Model – A pre-trained deep learning model that recognizes speech.

Audio Input Processing – Captures voice input through a microphone.

Speech Recognition Engine – Uses the Vosk model to convert speech to text.

Graphical User Interface (GUI) – Provides a user-friendly interface for input and display.

Text Output Handling – Displays the transcribed text in real-time.

AI Classification

This project falls under supervised learning within the broader category of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). The Vosk model is trained using labeled datasets, where audio recordings are mapped to their corresponding transcriptions.

Implementation Steps

1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:

pip install vosk PyQt5

2. Download and Extract Vosk Model

Download a suitable Vosk model from Vosk Models and extract it into your project folder.

3. Set Up the Project Directory

Your project structure should look like this:

SpeechToTextProject/
│-- vosk-model/  # Extracted Vosk model folder
│-- main.py  # Main application script
│-- README.md  # Project documentation

4. Implement the Speech Recognition Code

Write a Python script (main.py) that:

Loads the Vosk model

Captures microphone input

Processes speech and converts it to text

Displays the output in a GUI using PyQt5

5. Run the Application

Execute the script:

python main.py

Potential Enhancements

Improve the GUI interface for a better user experience.

Support multiple languages by using different Vosk models.

Implement real-time punctuation and formatting for improved transcription readability.

Conclusion

This Speech-to-Text Recognition System provides an efficient way to transcribe speech into text using Vosk. Its offline functionality makes it highly useful in various settings, including accessibility tools, automated transcription, and voice-driven applications. Future improvements can enhance its accuracy, usability, and multilingual support.
